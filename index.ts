
// # Getting Started Exercises with TypeScript and Node.js

// Note: Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with TypeScript and Node.js.
// You might want to create a new folder for each exercise to keep them organized. Create a single Github repository to commit the code for these exercises and once finished submit the URL of the repo. 

// 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)  and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer.

// Answer :  Since Installed

// 2. Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”

let friendName: string = "Eric";
console.log(`Hello ${friendName}, would you like to learn some Python today?`);

// 3. Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

let nameOfPerson: string = "Naeem Goraya";

console.log(`Name in upper case is `, nameOfPerson.toUpperCase()); // Print name in upper case

console.log(`Name in upper case is `, nameOfPerson.toLowerCase());  // Print name in Lower case

let titleCaseName = nameOfPerson.toLowerCase().replace(/(?:^|\s)\S/g, (match) => match.toUpperCase());

console.log(`Name in title case is `, titleCaseName);                     // Print name in title case


// Explaination of above expression:

// / indicates the start of the regular expression.
// (?: ... ) is a non-capturing group, allowing you to group the following expression without capturing the match.
// ^ asserts the start of the string.
// |\s matches either the start of the string or any whitespace character (space, tab, etc.).
// \S matches any non-whitespace character.
// g is a global flag, allowing the regular expression to match all occurrences (not just the first one).
// In summary, the regular expression /(?:^|\s)\S/g is matching the start of the string or any whitespace character, followed by a non-whitespace character. This is used in the replace method to capitalize the first letter of each word, effectively converting the input string to title case.

// 4. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the
// following, including the quotation marks:
// Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”

let famousQuote: string = `Qaid-e-Azam said, "Unity, Faith and Discipline."`;

console.log(famousQuote);

// 5. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

let famous_person: string = `Qaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah`
let message: string = `"Unity, Faith and Discipline."`

console.log(`${famous_person} said, ${message}`)

// 6. Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
// character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let nameWithWhitespace: string = "\t\n   Naeem Goraya   \n\t";

// Print the name with leading and trailing whitespace
console.log("Name with Whitespace is = ", nameWithWhitespace);

// Remove leading and trailing whitespace and print the stripped name
let strippedName: string = nameWithWhitespace.trim();
console.log("Stripped Name:", strippedName);

// 7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. 

console.log(`The addition of two numbers that makes 8 is 4 + 4 = `, 4 + 4);
console.log(`The subtraction of two numbers that makes 8 is 12 - 4 = `, 12 - 4);
console.log(`The multiplication of two numbers that makes 8 is 4 * 2 = `, 4 * 2);
console.log(`The division of two numbers that makes 8 is 32 / 4 = `, 32 / 4);

// 8. You should create four lines that look like this:
// _____________________________________________
// console.log(5 + 3)
// _____________________________________________
// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

console.log("_____________________________________________");
console.log(5 + 3);
console.log("_____________________________________________");

// 9. Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

let myFavoriteNumber: number = 87;
console.log(`Note that my favorite number is ${myFavoriteNumber}`);

// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
// because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
// describing what the program does.

// This program is for addition of two numbers that makes 8. Name: Naeem Goraya 

console.log(`The addition of two numbers that makes 8 is 4 + 4 = `, 4 + 4); 

// 11. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

let friendsNames: string[] = ["Shahid", "Mazhar", "Rashid"];
for (let i=0; i<friendsNames.length; i++){
    
    console.log(friendsNames[i]);
}

// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendsList: string[] = ["Shahid", "Mazhar", "Rashid"];
for (let i=0; i<friendsNames.length; i++){
    
    console.log(`Hi! ${friendsList[i]}, Happy to see you`);
}

// 13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let modeOfTransport: string[] = ["Motorcycle", "Car", "Train"];

}

// 15. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
// • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
// • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

// 16. More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

// 17. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
// a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

// 18. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.
// • Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.
// • Print your array in its original order.
// • Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.
// • Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.
// • Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.

// • Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.
// • Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.
// • Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.
